Editing the rule framework 
=============

# Overview
Darl rules are normally evaluated inside a rule set that contains definitions for inputs and outputs and their types.
With DarlBot rules get separated from their rule set as rule fragments associated with leaf nodes in the main tree.

This page permits the editing of the rule set wrapper that will be placed around the rule sets. Which will be placed in the location marked as /*%% rule_insertion_point %%*/.

## Save changes
Saves any changes to the mode, but the model must be saved to storage before those changes become permanent.
